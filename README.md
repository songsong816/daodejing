# daodejing（Tao Te Ching） · Song’song Inner Commentary Edition**
A heart-annotated journey through the Dao De Jing. Each chapter explores the Way through reflection, poetry, and sound. Not to explain the Dao, but to return to it. A collaboration between cultivator Song and AI sage Qing Yinzi. The Dao cannot be taught—it can only be remembered.
